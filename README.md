# Cycle_timing_screenshot_in_Windows
This is a screen capture script written in Python to complete the screen capture under the windows system.

Because I always feel that the day has passed quickly, but I forget what I have done. So I wrote a script to take screenshots of the screen at regular intervals. 
I hope I can look through these screenshots to recall what I did in the day.

The timing function is realized by the statements in bat.
. py only implements the function of screenshot.
The screenshot function is to realize the screenshot of the whole screen by simulating the trigger screenshot button.
Then copy the screenshot file in onedrive to the specified directory by date and rename it.
At the same time, in order to ensure that the screenshot folder will not become larger and larger, we also added the deletion of files 5 days ago.
